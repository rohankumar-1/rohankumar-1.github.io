<h1>About Me</h1>

As of October 2024, I am a senior at Boston University, majoring in computer engineering. My coursework has been generally focused on machine learning, and more general computer science and data science related topics. My aspirations are to enter graduate school for operations research, which is a field that I find fascinating and will hopefully give me the analytical tools to tackle any problem that comes my way. 

Some of my research/academic interests are:
- operations research
- convex optimization theory
- information theory
- natural language processing
- data structures and algorithms


And personal interests are:
- philosophy
- soccer (especially Arsenal, Munich, Napoli)
- food tourism
