- [machine-learning]: build a GAN from scratch to do some task
    - rebuild medical datasets?
    - learn a normal distribution -> gaussian distribution function

- [operations-research]: Factorio from an OR perspective
    - when to improve science instead of reoptimizing system ?

- [machine-learning]: does the brain work as a calculator, computing functions given some f(external input, data) --> output ?
    - how do we reason?

- [OCR-Image]: build a tool that takes chalkboard lectures (i.e. MIT OpenCourseware) and turn it into an annotated lecture with slides showing what the professor has written
    - isolate board, then for each pixel, predict if that pixel is written to
    - need to contend with
